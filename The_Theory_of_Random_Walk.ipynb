    "# What is random walk?\n",
    "A random walk is the process by which randomly-moving objects wander away from where they started. Yes, that is it, easy-peasy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets understand this with the help of an example.\n",
    "Suppose you have a unbiased(having 50:50 chances of Heads and Tails) coin. You are going to flip it 100 times and if you get a Heads you will move forward a step and on the other hand if you get a Tails you will move a step back. And after completing 100 flips see how far backwards or forwards are you from the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will thinking, this is mundane and probably this has no practical use. And I must confess I thought the exact same.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to our surprise **Random Walk** has a plethora of applications and have gave rise to make mathematical and statistical studies.<br>\n",
    "The path traced by a molecule as it travels in a liquid or a gas, the search path of a foraging animal, the price of a fluctuating stock and the financial status of a gambler: all can be approximated by random walk models, even though they may not be truly random in reality.\n",
    "\n",

And arithmetic operations on vectors help us compute data simultaneously rather than on repeating an operation. Confused? take a look the example below and revist the theory."
